### Research interests

* The major research interests are related to *turbulent flows* in natural and 
industrial applications. 
* We study the boundary layer flows, turbulent flows with  additives, particle-laden flows, 
scalar (heat, temperature, concentration) dispersion in turbulent flows, and others. 
* We develop unique *experimental methods* to measure velocity and velocity derivatives of 
turbulent flows in Eulerian and Lagrangian framework.

### Current research projects
1. Stratified turbulent flows: 
   * stratified patch
   * accelerating airfoil
2. Turbulent flows with dilute polymers
3. Resuspension of particulate materials
4. Fluid-structure interaction of flexible plates
   * robotic micro-swimmer
   * flexible blade rheometer
5. Bio-medical flows: 
   * optical flow for the LV
   * hydraulic modeling of the coronary tree
4. Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry

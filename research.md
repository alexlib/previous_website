### Research interests

* The major research interests are related to *turbulent flows* in natural and 
industrial applications. 
* We study the boundary layer flows, turbulent flows with  additives, particle-laden flows, 
scalar (heat, temperature, concentration) dispersion in turbulent flows, and others. 
* We develop unique *experimental methods* to measure velocity and velocity derivatives of 
turbulent flows in Eulerian and Lagrangian framework.

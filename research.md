## Research interests

* The major research interests are related to *turbulent flows* in natural and 
industrial applications. 
* We study the boundary layer flows, turbulent flows with  additives, particle-laden flows, 
scalar (heat, temperature, concentration) dispersion in turbulent flows, and others. 
* We develop unique *experimental methods* to measure velocity and velocity derivatives of 
turbulent flows in Eulerian and Lagrangian framework.

## Research projects
1. Stratified turbulent flows:
   * Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of stratified wakes  
   * dispersion of a stratified patch
   * flow in the wake of an accelerating hydrofoil
2. Turbulent flows with dilute polymers
3. Resuspension of particulate materials
4. Fluid-structure interaction of flexible objects
   * robotic micro-swimmer
   * flexible blade rheometer
5. Biomedical flows: 
   * optical flow for the LV analysis
   * hydraulic modeling of a coronary tree
4. Lagrangian particle tracking velocimetry
   * real time image processing on FPGA
   * single camera four-view image spitter
   * streaks velocimetry
5. Lid driven cavity
   * Lagrangian description
   * Instability in cubic cavities
6. Heat transfer and cooling of electronic devices
   * periodic and aperiodic flows in a PC case
   * unsteady airflow cooling of CPU heat sink

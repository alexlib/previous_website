    <div class="content"><p>We propose to experimentally investigate  the breakup mechanism of
colloids in turbulent flows. The main experimental tool is <a href="../an_introduction_to_3d_ptv/index.html" class="extiw path" title="path:wiki/an introduction to 3d ptv">three
dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV),</a> a whole field
non intrusive flow diagnostic technique, applied to  turbulent flow
of water and suspended colloids.Colloids are constellations of tiny particles on the order of micron
scale. Aggregation and breakage of colloids are quite prevalent
phenomena in a variety of flows spanning from industrial processes
such as crystallization, separation and reaction in multi phase
systems to environmental flows like bio geochemical cycle of marine
colloid and transport of toxic elements. Another prominent example
of colloidal suspensions is aerosols. Aggregation and breakage of
colloids are key to understanding of processes occurring in
different flow domains.
</p><p>Detailed knowledge of the turbulent flow field around a colloid
prone to break is indispensable to comprehend the breakage dynamics.
Therefore, it is absolutely vital to have thorough access to the
properties of the turbulent flow in the close proximity of the
colloid before, during and after its breakage. This necessitates to
gain the full fledged Lagrangian statistics of the flow field and of
the colloid motion. This demand  for simultaneous measurement of the
turbulent flow features and tracking the colloid not only as a
single entity but also together with the produced fragments asks the
experimental tool to be capable of pursuing the particles along its
Lagrangian trajectory and at the same time to provide the full
information about velocity gradients in its vicinity. Therefore in
this proposed work we intend to further advance our knowledge to
clarify the interaction between the turbulent flow field and
aggregate breakage by spatiotemporal breakage detection with
improved accuracy and adapt the existing 3D-PTV algorithm
accordingly.
</p><p>Since disaggregation of colloids due to turbulence is in the main
focus, we need to bridge the expertise on chemical and mechanical
aspects of the colloids (primary particle size, surfactant,
destabilizer concentration, aggregation mode etc.) with the
experimental turbulence. We receive constant feedback from another
ETH institute namely Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering as
they have adequate experience of colloid aggregation and breakage in
different flow environment. We would like to constantly verify
breakage as detected from our main work horse 3D-PTV with the small
angle static light scattering (SASLS) technique extensively used by
our collaborator. It will advance our knowledge of colloid breakage,
which is absolutely necessary, e.g., for modeling, design, and
manufacturing of next generation industrial mixers. From the basic
point of view the understanding of colloid breakage is closely
related to the field of passive objects such as material lines and
surfaces, fluid particles and the evolution of multi-point
constellations in turbulent flows.
</p><p>It is our goal to measure velocity gradients around breaking
colloids with 3D-PTV in increasingly more realistic flow
environments, i.e. towards industrial stirring and mixing vessels.
We will start with a relatively simple situation of a contracting
duct and then gradually increase the complexity of the flow field.
Milestones of the proposed project are: Measure simultaneously
velocity gradients and breakage with 3D-PTV in orifice, identify
Lagrangian velocity gradient breakage criteria in isotropic
turbulence and as a bonus milestone provide benchmark data for CFD
(Computational fluid dynamics) simulation of breakage in LTC (Lobbed
Taylor Couette) unit.
</p><p><br />
The highlights of our proposed research plan can be presented as
follows: We want to combine IfU's Lagrangian measuring technique
3D-PTV with the experience and equipment of the Morbidelli group in
colloidal engineering and thereby obtain detailed Lagrangian
experimental data on colloidal breakage. We start with a relatively
simple experiment in an orifice, measure Lagrangian information
about breakage, approach the breakage problem in a more realistic
turbulent flow, and finally measure in an industry relevant stirring
apparatus, the patented, lobbed Taylor Couette facility. It is all
about identifying precisely what flow situations and Lagrangian flow
histories results in breakage of colloids. The following sections
will sequentially unfold the scheme of the research program.
